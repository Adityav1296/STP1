## Description
Download this image and find the flag.

## Solve
**Flag:**`picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_a9a181eb}`

- Since it is an image, I first tried to extract the metadata of the image to look for the flag but no luck.
- Then I looked for it in the hex data of the image but there also I couldn't find any specific pattern.
- I extracted the strings from the image as well but no luck.
- `binwalk` also did not give anything useful.
   
   commands 

-  I couldn't use steghide since it needs a passphrase. So finally I tried `zsteg` command and found the flag.

## Learnings
1. Text and compressed files can be hidden inside pictures and images. We need to use certaing image steganography tools to extract that hidden data.
2. Sometimes the hidden text is directly visible on the image itself and can be viewed by changing the color saturation and contrast of the image. Other times, we need to extract it from the metadata or the binary data of the image.
