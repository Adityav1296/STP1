## Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_0c0db339}`

- In this challenge, I started with intercepting the request using the burp suite. The first page showed that it will only accept users who use the PicoBrower. So I changed the user-agent to PicoBrowser:

- Now I added the Referer header and set the value as the website url:

- This time I had to add the Date header:

- To make sure that I wasn't being tracked, I set the DNT header and set the value to 1:

- Then it said that I had to be from Sweden. So I used the X-Forwarder-For header and set a random ip address from Sweden that I searched up:

- Finally I set the Accept-Language to Swedish:
