# SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

## Description
 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user. 

## Solve

- For this lab, we just have to login as the administrator. For this, when we go to the login page and submit the username as adminitrator and any random password with it, the following request is sent:

- This request makes the following sql query:

```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND password = 'abracadabra'
```

- Now, since we don't know the login password for the administrator, the only thing we can try is to comment out the password part from the query by using `'--`.
