## Description
ABC Bank's website has a loan calculator to help its clients calculate the amount they pay if they take a loan from the bank. Unfortunately, they are using an eval function to calculate the loan. Bypassing this will give you Remote Code Execution (RCE). Can you exploit the bank's calculator and read the flag?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solve
*Flag:** `picoCTF{D0nt_Use_Unsecure_f@nctions0c312090}`

- On launching the challenge, it displayed the calculator. When I checked the source code of the site, it showed the blacklisted words and the regex expressions.

- So from there, I started searching for substiutes for my payload that can bypass the restrictions. Looking around, I found that we can encode `cat /flag.txt` in base64 and use that. Therefore, final payload: `open(__import__('base64').b64decode('L2ZsYWcudHh0').decode()).read()`
