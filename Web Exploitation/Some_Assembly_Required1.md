**Flag:** `picoCTF{8857462f9e30faae4d037e5e25fee1ce}`

- On launching the challenge, it again took me to a separate site. There the first thing I did was to inspect the code. There I found a javascript file.

- Then, I went to the Debugger console. From there I downloaded the javascript file and on arranging it with proper word formatting, I found that it was fetching a webassembly file called `JIFxzHyW8W`.
- Initially I tried to intercept the GET requests using the burp suite but for some reason it didn't work as the burp suite did not show any requests being forwarded or intercepted even when I tried submitting the random flag. 
- Then, just looking at the Debugger console again, there was the wasm:// option that I didn't check before. So I checked it just in case. This opened up a webassembly module. At the very end of the module was the required flag.
