# DOM XSS in innerHTML sink using source location.search

## Description
 This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. It uses an innerHTML assignment, which changes the HTML contents of a div element, using data from location.search.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function. 

## Solve

- On launching the challenge, it displayed the site below:

- Now since we needed to access the alert function, I searched it up and found the commonly used attack vectors. Then using `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS")>` payload, I was able to solve the challenge.
