## Description
Can you break into this super secure portal? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/17682/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:17682

## Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{no_clients_plz_b706c5}`

- On clicking the portal link provided in the description, a new site opened which required us to login through a password.

- Since no other clue had been provided in the description, I checked the most basic place, i.e, the source code of the page. There itself, I found the password for login which also happened to be the flag for the challenge by rearranging the substrings given.

## Learnings
1. The code made up of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that is read and processed by the web browser rendering the visuals for the websites is called the source code. 
2. Reading the source code can sometimes help us in finding hidden underlying links as well.
