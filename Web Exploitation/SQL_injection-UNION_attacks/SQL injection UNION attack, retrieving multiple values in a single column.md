# UNION Attacks

## SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column

### Description
 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user. 

### Solve

- Here, I caputred the outgoing request and then found out that there are two columns in the database. Then I found the columns compatible with string data:

- It turned out that there was only one column in which string data can be present but we needed to find both the username and the password both of which are string data types. 
- So, I concatenated them using the following payload: `UNION+SELECT+NULL,username||'->'||password+FROM+USERS--`

- Once done, I got the passwords of all the users present in the users table:

### Learnings
1. String concatenation can be used to include string data of multiple table columns into a single column while displaying. Different operating systems might use different string concatenators.
