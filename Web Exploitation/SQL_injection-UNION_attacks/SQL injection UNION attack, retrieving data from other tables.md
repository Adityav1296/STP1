# UNION Attacks

## SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

### Description
 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the techniques you learned in previous labs.

The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user. 

### Solve

- In this lab also, first I intercepted the request using burp suite

   intercept

- Then I found out the number of columns in the database:

   no. of columns

- Third thing I did was to find out the columns that can handle string data:

   string

- It turned out that both the columns are compatible with string data. Then I further modified my query to search for username and password in the users table where the username is adminitrator and found the password to it:

   password

- Finally I logged in as the administrator and completed the lab.
