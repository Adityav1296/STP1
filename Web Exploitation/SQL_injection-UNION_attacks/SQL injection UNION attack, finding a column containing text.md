# UNION Attacks

## SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text

### Description
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you first need to determine the number of columns returned by the query. You can do this using a technique you learned in a previous lab. The next step is to identify a column that is compatible with string data.

The lab will provide a random value that you need to make appear within the query results. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided. This technique helps you determine which columns are compatible with string data. 

### Solve

- I intercepted the following request using the burp suite first:

- Then I sent it to the repeater and started finding out the number of columns in the database. It turned out that the database had 3 columns in it. 
- Now to find a column that was compatible with string data, I started typing the letter `'k'` in place of the NULL values one at a time. On replacing the second position NULL, I got an error free output:

- Once I found the compatible column, I replaced the letter k with the string `'VgF5NE'` that we had to display for solving the lab and forwarded the request to get the following output and clear the lab:

### Learnings
1. We can find columns compatible with different datatypes in the sql attacks. Generally, the column contents are in the string format so to find that we can use the following queries:

```
' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
```

2. If the column data type is not compatible with string data, the injected query will cause a database error.
