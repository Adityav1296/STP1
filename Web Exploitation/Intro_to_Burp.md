- On launching the challenge instance, we were taken to a different site asking us to register on it.

- After filling out the columns with random values, I clicked on register to send the request. Here, I used the Burp suite to intercept the outgoing POST request and sent it to the repeater to see if we can manipulate it somehow.

- But even after changing the values inside multiple columns like username, password, city and leaving them empty as well, nothing meaningful showed up in the repeater. So at the end, I just forwarded the request as it is.
- Then the next page asked for an OTP but since we were not given any OTP in the challenge, I just filled a random value and clicked submit. Then I again intercepted the request using Burp suite and sent it to the repeater.
- This time around, there was only one field, i.e, otp. So at first I tried to input letters in it instead of numbers to see if it would show something but it just showed invalid otp no matter if the input value was a letter or a number.

- In the end, I checked what it would show if I deleted this field. As I did this and forwarded the request in the repeater, I got the flag.

## Learnings
1. Different http requests have different methods that define how they work. These methods are written at the beginning of the request. For example: POST, GET, DELETE, etc.
2. In the burp suite, we can intercept the outgoing http requests and then use the repeater to check the outcomes of different manipulations on the request without actually sending the request to the server every single time.
