# SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle

## Description
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.

To solve the lab, log in as the administrator user. 

## Solve

-  First I intercepted the request and sent it to the repeater using burp suite. 
- Now, I tried to find the number of columns using the built in table dual in Oracle. It turned out that there are two columns and both are string compatible.
- Then I listed out all the table names present in the database:

- In that, I found the users table name: `USERS_SULLQN`
- Now, using that I found the username and password columns in the users table which were: `USERNAME_LNFRUA` and `PASSWORD_DPSSAZ`
- Finally, I used them to find the password for the administrator user:
