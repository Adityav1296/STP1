# SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases

## Description
 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.

To solve the lab, log in as the administrator user. 

## Solve

- First I intercepted the request and sent it to the repeater using burp suite. 
- Now, I tried to find the number of columns in the information.schema database which turned out to be two and both of them were compatible with string data. 
- So I used one of the columns to list out the names of the tables present in the information.schema database.

   table 
- From the listed names, I found the name for the users table that contained the username and password information: `users_jluhtd`
- After getting the name of the users table, I looked for the names of the columns present in the table:
   
   columns
- In that existed two columns namely: `username_rosjwe` and `password_nroaqu`
- Now I just needed to find the password for the administrator using these two columns. The password turned out to be: `3s19mysprxy18h4dqr7d`. After finding the password I logged in as the administrator and completed the lab.
