## Forbidden Paths
Author: LT 'syreal' Jones

Category: Web Exploitation

Difficulty: Medium

## Description
Can you get the flag? We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solve 
**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}`

- In this challenge, the task was straight forward. We just had to figure out the relative path to the flag.txt file since absolute paths were not accepted. Final path: `./../../../flag.txt`
