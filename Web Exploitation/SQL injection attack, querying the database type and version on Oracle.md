# SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle

## Description
 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.

To solve the lab, display the database version string. 

## Solve

- In this lab, after intercepting the request, I first found the number of columns in the database. Since it is ORACLE database, we need to provide it a table to query through. Here, we use the 'dual' data table.

- After confirming there are 2 columns, I also confirmed that both of them can handle string values. 
- Then, I looked up the possible payloads for finding the database version of Oracle. Once I got the correct payload, I ran it and then solved the lab.

## Learnings
1. Different operating systems can have different queries for finding the version and type information.

2. The DUAL table in Oracle is a special, built-in table used primarily for selecting pseudo-columns or performing calculations that do not require data from an actual table.
