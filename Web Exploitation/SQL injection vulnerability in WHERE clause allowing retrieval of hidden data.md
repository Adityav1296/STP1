# SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

## Description
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following: 

```
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products. 

## Solve

- Using the burp suite we intercept the outgoing GET request which looks like this:
 
   get

- Now we try using the basic boolean attacks to list out the unreleased products as well. Working attack looks like this:

   attack

## Learning
1. Boolean conditions can be used to perform such SQL injection attacks but we must be careful when using them as it's common for applications to use data from a single request in multiple different queries. If your condition reaches an UPDATE or DELETE statement, for example, it can result in an accidental loss of data.
