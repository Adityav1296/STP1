# SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft

## Description
 This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.

To solve the lab, display the database version string. 

## Solve

- In this lab, after intercepting the request, I first found the number of columns in the database which turned out to be two and they both were able to accept string data. The only thing different here was that the `--` used to comment out the rest of the request had to be replaced by `#`.
- After confirming that, I used the payload : `'UNION+SELECT+@@version,+NULL#` and found the version info:

## Learning
1. Unlike Oracle, the windows and MySQL systems don't require us to necessarily make a query to a table. Therefore we don't need to use builtin tables like dual here.
