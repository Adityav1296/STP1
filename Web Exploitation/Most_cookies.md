## Most Cookies

Difficulty: Medium

## Description
Alright, enough of using my own encryption. Flask session cookies should be plenty secure! server.py http://mercury.picoctf.net:52134/

## Solve 
**Flag:** `picoCTF{pwn_4ll_th3_cook1E5_478da04c}`

- In this challenge, we are given a flask application file: server.py. In that file, there is a list of cookies and out of them, a random cookie is selected to make the session secret key.
   
   cookie

- As the challenge name suggests, we need to find the correct cookie value to gain access to the flag. I initially just typed the `snickerdoodle` value that is already shown on the content box. But as expected, it was the incorrect value.
- So after searching around, I found a site that contained all the necessary commands to deal with these cookies.
- Using that, I found that these cookies are base64 encoded. So I decoded the cookie and found: 

   snickerdoodle

- Now the next task was to find the secret key being used in the cookie as that will allow me to modify it to set the value `{'very_auth': 'admin'}`. So I did this: 

   wordlist

- Now, once I got the secret key, I made my own signed cookie with the value set to admin:
 
   signed cookie

- I then copied this cookie to the website and replaced the original cookie with it. On reloading the site, I found the flag.
