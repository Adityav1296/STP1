# Rotten Apple

## Description
Among the debris of this floor, you find a relic of sound: An album which turns out to be D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L by Panchiko, a long lost album. But the music is warped, as though it has undergone disc rot.

The path forward is hidden in the distortion. Similar to how the album was warped, the password to the next floor has been warped first by a factor of 47, then by a factor of 13. Untangle these changes to reveal the code and continue your ascent.

> 4:R256=Y3oRRoP0#~%Ro?A

## Solve
**Flag:** `citadel{b3tt3r_ROTt3n}`

- In this challenge, the description clearly mentions the word ROT and then we are given factor of 47 followed by factor of 13. Therefore, we first need decrypt using ROT 13 and then decrupt ROT 47.
