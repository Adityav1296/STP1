# Schlagenheim

## Description
Your quest continues, but you feel something odd about this room. The only artifact on this floor is a corrupted file held in the hands of a jet-black statue, frozen in the pose of a band mid-performance. The passcode to the next floor is hidden within this piece of music, but it canâ€™t be played, as if the wrong extension has scrambled it.

You must take the corrupted file and repair it to reveal the true code that will unlock the door forward.

## Solve
**Flag:** `citadel{8lackM1D1wa5c00l}`

- For this challenge, since the description tells us that the file is scrambled with a wrong extension, the first thing I did was to use a hex editor to see if I can find some clue:

- This shows that the file is a M1D1 file, which is actually a MIDI file used for music production. Now, I looked up the magic bytes for MIDI files and set them up correctly and saved the file:

- Using a MIDI player, I played the file and found the flag.
